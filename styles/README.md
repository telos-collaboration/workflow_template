# Plot styles

This directory contains `.mplstyle` files for Matplotlib,
for common use cases.

Since they give a common appearance across all our work,
they should only be modified after discussion with the collaboration.
Currently,
they comprise

- `paperdraft.mplstyle`:
  Light background, LaTeX fonts.
  Designed to match the style of an arXiv draft.
- `poster.mplstyle`:
  Light background, Futura font.
  Designed to more closely match a sans-serif poster.
- `darkslide.mplstyle`:
  Dark background, Futura font.
  Designed to be easily legible on,
  for example,
  a slide deck with a dark background
  and set in sans-serif font.

If you need to expand this set,
please discuss with the collaboration.
