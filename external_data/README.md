# External data

If your analysis quotes data that have not been released as data,
for example numbers extracted from plots or tables in another paper,
they should be placed in this directory in CSV format,
and the main `README.md` file should be updated to mention this,
adding a link and citation to the source of the data.

If your analysis quotes data from another data release,
this _must not_ be included in this directory.
Instead,
either update the main `README.md` to instruct the user on
where to download the data from
and where to place them,
or update the workflow to download the data from Zenodo automatically.
